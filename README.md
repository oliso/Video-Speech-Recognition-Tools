# Video-Speech-Recognition-Tools

This is a repository containing a few tools that I developed for transcription of speech from videos. The basis for these tools is the speech_recognition python package, with which I was able to utilise common APIs like Google speech recognition and IBM speech-to-text.

Note: You'll need to sign up on IBM cloud (for free) and request an API key to use the speech-to-text service.
